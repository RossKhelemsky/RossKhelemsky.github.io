Today I am going to analyse the proposed 1\$ increase in the gas tax in 2005 using Rstudio and time-series data on income, gas consumption, gas prices, and the prices of all other goods. I will use OLS multiple linear regression to estimate a relationship between gas consumption, real income, and the real price of gas(and find out how much gas consumption would decrease from a 1\$ increase in price, the effect of the tax). Then I will fit the data to the indirect utility function from Hausman(1981) to estimate the mean consumer's loss of utility from the tax. Then I will rearrange the function into the expenditure function to estimate how much is required in compensation for the consumer to be indifferent to the price change. After that, I will estimate the new consumption of gas after the tax and rebate. Then I will estimate the per capita tax revenue with and without compensation, and carbon emissions reduction with and without compensation. Finally, I will discuss the conditions under which the tax and rebate would be welfare-enhancing. Special thanks to Dr.Joseph Hughes, who taught me for intermediate micro, compiled the data for this analysis, and came up with a significant proportion of the methodology.

Let's begin:

```r
library(haven)
gastaxdata<- (SAS_data)
summary(gastaxdata)
SAS_data is the dataset I am going to use for this analysis. Since it is in SAS format, I have to use the haven package to import it into Rstudio. It contains time-series data on annual per capita gas consumption(in gallons), annual per capita nominal income(disposable less savings), average nominal price of gas(per gallon), and price of all other goods(CPI less energy) from 1984-2005.

Summary(gastaxdata) displays summary statistics for the variables in the dataset (minimum, 1st quartile, median mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum). The summary statistics for gastaxdata are displayed in the figure below:
